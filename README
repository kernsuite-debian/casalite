CASA Linux Distribution
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
To setup your environment to use CASA, add the root directory of the
unpacked CASA distribution to your PATH environment variable. For
example, if you unpacked the 4.4.0 casa distribution:

    tar xf casa-release-4.4.0-el6.tar.gz

you could setup your environment to use CASA in bash like:

    cd casa-release-4.4.0-el6/bin
    PATH=`pwd`:$PATH

or if you use tcsh, you could setup your environment like:

    cd casa-release-4.4.0-el6/bin
    setenv PATH `pwd`:$PATH

You can use the casa-config script for extra information about this
distribution and for configuration. For example, to find the version
number of this distribution:

    casa-config --version

or to install a package into this CASA distribution:

    casa-config --exec python setup.py
